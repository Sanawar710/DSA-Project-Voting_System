- Course: CS221 - Data Structures and Algorithms
- Project Overvie : A voting system implemented using core concepts from "Data Structures and Algorithms".

- Key Data Structures Use :
  1. Structure : For organizing candidate and voter information.
  2. Linked Lists, HashMaps, and File Handling : For storing and retrieving candidate and voter data.
  3. Binary Search Tree BST : To prevent duplicate voting.
  4. Weighted Graph : For visualizing and analyzing election results.
  5. Queue : To manage voter priorities while standing in line.
  6. Stack : For sorting candidates based on their information.
  
The project integrates these data structures to create a functional and efficient voting system.
