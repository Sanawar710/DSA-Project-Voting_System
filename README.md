Course: CS221 - Data Structures and Algorithms  

Project Overview:  
A voting system designed and implemented using core concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms.  

Key Data Structures Used:  
1. Structures: To organize and manage candidate and voter information.  
2. Linked Lists, HashMaps, and File Handling: For efficient storage and retrieval of candidate and voter data.  
3. Binary Search Tree (BST): To ensure duplicate voting is prevented.  
4. Weighted Graph: To visualize and analyze election results.  
5. Queue: To handle voter priorities while managing the voting queue.  
6. Stack: For sorting candidates based on specific criteria.  

This project integrates these data structures to develop a functional, efficient, and reliable voting system.
